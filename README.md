# NeuroPricel mod
Mod adds block, where the construct of Pricel lives.
You can talk with the Pricel using book and quill. He will speak...

Pricel only interacts with separately hosted servers - for voice generation and for text generation...\
IP-s of the servers are defined in the config of the mod.

Voice server: https://github.com/TemanSv1n/Neuropricel-coqui \
Text server: https://github.com/TemanSv1n/NeuropricelLLM---Gemini-google--HTTP-server

You can use any other servers, pricel utilises HTTP for requesting, just obey the structure of requests.
